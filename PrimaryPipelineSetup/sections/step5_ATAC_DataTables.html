<p>The number of transposase sites from each cell that fall within each peak region is represented in the matrix market exchange (MEX) format.
    <ul>
        <li>The MEX format is an efficient way to store sparse data, and is a common input format for many single-cell analysis tools. </li>
        <li>The MEX.zip output files contain three separate gzip compressed files that together represent the number of transposase sites of each peak in each cell. </li>
        <li>By convention, these files are named:</li><br>

                    Cell indexes in the atac-barcodes.tsv file are sorted numerically.</td>
