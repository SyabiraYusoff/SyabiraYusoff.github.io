    <ul>
        <li><b>Upload directly on Cloud Platform:</b>
            <p>This approach is suitable for users who have the files on their local machine and want to upload them to the Velsera platform.However, it is recommended to upload your files through Command Line Interface (CLI) for files more than 1GB size.</p></li>
        <li><b>Copy files from other projects:</b>
            <p>Some experienced users might want to use the same files or pipeline from other projects. This chapter includes a tutorial on how to copy files from other projects you have created. Please navigate to the Cloud Based Upload menu.</p></li>
        <li><b>Upload through FTP or HTTPS:</b>
            <p>This approach is suitable when you have files from AWS or any other resource that is accessible through an FTP or HTTPS link. For example, reference files that are available publicly on a cloud platform.</p></li>
        <li><b>Command Line Interface:</b>
            <p>This approach is useful when you have large files to upload and don't want to stay in front of your web browser. Please navigate to the CLI for MacOS or Windows.</p></li>
    </ul>
